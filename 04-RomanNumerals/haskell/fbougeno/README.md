# Roman Numerals

Solution in Haskell (my first Haskell project).

## Requirements
* Stack (https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/).

## Tests
To run the tests, just open a terminal and type:
```bash
stack test
```

## Limitations

At the moment, this code converts from decimal to roman. The roman to decimal conversion is a WIP.
