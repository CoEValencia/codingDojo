# Trick or Treat Rules

* Packs can contain candy or fruit, anything that isn't a piece of candy will be taken as fruit
* One pack per child
* Every pack must contain at least 2 pieces of candy
* Every pack must contain more candy than fruit, children may get angry otherwise
* Every pack must contain the same amount of candy, just to prevent fights
* Packs must **not** contain khakis, they're disgusting!
